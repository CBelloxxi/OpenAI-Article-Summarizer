# OpenAI-Article-Summarizer

<p> This is the OpenAI Article Summarizer App built with a Modern UI/UX using Vite, React JS, TailwindCSS, React Redux and RapidAPI Summarizer Api. It encompasses all modern UX Practices, follows a stringent and well-organised File Structure, uses React Functional components to create components, tailwindcss for all styling, Vite has been used as the bundler for this build. Redux has been used to handle services, store and to create the API. Redux imports include; Provider, configureStore, createApi, fetchBaseQuery all from redux toolkit. Reducer has been used to define the slice for the redux store, middleware has been used to intercept the articleApi action before it reaches the reducer and modifies the action according to redux documentation. It also uses Lazy Loading to only use the Api on client submission. Netlify has also been used for hosting. </p>

<h2>Improve or Change</h2>
The next steps to continue building this into a fully-fledged app would be to build a sign up, sign-in and potentially use 2FA for authentication and add a payment processor like stripe to make the app into a fully-fledged saas product and also build an admin panel to monitor account usage. Lastly I would add an AI customer service chatbot to deal with customer queries.
